there is poor ventilation, are riskier than outdoor locations. activities where more particles are expelled from the mouth, such as singing or breathing heavily during exercise, also increase the risk of transmission.the “three c’s” are a useful way to think about this. they describe settings where transmission of the covid-19 virus spreads more easily:crowded places;close-contact settings, especially where people have conversations very near each other;confined and enclosed spaces with poor ventilation.  the risk of covid-19 spreading is especially high in places where these “3cs” overlap.in health facilities where people are receiving treatment for covid-19, there is an increased risk of infection during medical procedures called aerosol generating procedures. these can produce very small droplets that can stay suspended in the air for longer periods of time and spread beyond conversational distances (typically 1 meter). this is why health workers performing these procedures or in settings where these procedures are performed should take specific airborne protection measures, including using appropriate personal protective equipment such as respirators. this is also why visitors are not permitted in areas where these procedures are being performed.'\n","\n","The topic 'fuckyourmask unvaxxed takeoffyourmask malicious nefarious deplorable premeditated frighten

are an important part of child development and health. no child should be denied access to school or activities because of lack of a mask.some countries and regions may have specific policies or recommendations in place. as always, follow the guidance provided by your country or local health department or ministry.who and unicef recommend the following: children aged 5 years and under do not need to wear a mask because in this age group, they may not be able to properly wear a mask without help or supervision.2. in areas where sars-cov-2 is spreading, children ages 6-11 years are recommended to wear a well-fitted maskin indoor settings where ventilation is poor or unknown, even if physical distancing of at least 1 meter can be maintained; andin indoor settings that have adequate ventilation when physical distancing of at least 1 meter cannot be maintained.  3. adolescents 12 years or older should follow the same who recommendations for mask use as adults:a well-fitted mask that covers the nose and mouth should be worn in settings where sars cov-2 is spreading, regardless of vaccination status or history of prior infection, when interacting with individuals who are not members of their household:in indoor settings where ventilation is known to be poor or cannot be assessed, or the ventilation system is not properly maintained, regardless of whether physical distancing of at least 1 meter can be maintainedin indoor settings that have adequate ventilation if physical distancing of at least 1 meter cannot be maintained; orin outdoor settings where physical distancing of at least 1 meter cannot be maintained. as much as possible, it is important that children of all ages keep their hands clean when putting on and taking off their mask.a safe environment should be created for children who are not able to tolerate a mask, including requirements for caregivers, teachers or other adults interacting with the child to wear a mask

scope. the new accord could represent a global commitment to work together, as an international community, to help prevent disease outbreaks from impacting individuals, communities, countries and the world in the same way as the covid-19 pandemic did.importantly, any new accord would be expected to establish principles, priorities and targets for pandemic preparedness and response, with the aim to:build resilience to pandemics;support prevention, detection, and responses to outbreaks with pandemic potential;ensure equitable access to pandemic countermeasures; andsupport global coordination through a stronger and more accountable who.the new accord could complement other initiatives, actions and measures aimed at making the world safer from pandemics, including the  international health regulations and global institutions and systems working to equitably share health technologies, information and expertise.the proposed accord could take the lessons learned from the covid-19 pandemic and use them to build back better. equity is one of the key principles being discussed as part of the work on the new accord.a new accord could promote political commitment at the highest level,

realunderlying impact of covid-19 in different countries – especially lowerand middle income countries that may not have developed healthinformation systems to guide a targeted response. deathsdirectly attributable to covid-19 provide only a narrow perspective ofthe wide ranging harms being caused by the pandemic. the collateraldamage from covid-19 is much wider. it is important to quantify this nowas it can inform choices that governments must make regardingprioritization between routine and emergency health systems.the utility of the excess mortality estimates goes beyond estimation of the impact of the covid-19 pandemic. it underlines the significance of investing in health and better targeting of interventions and resources to those most in need to prevent future deaths. these estimates will serve to underscore to governments around the world the need to sharpen their data tools and specifically improve civil registration and vital statistics (crvs), mortality surveillance, and data and health information systems.estimatesof excess mortality associated with the covid-19 pandemic are also critical inputsfor other important work currently underway. for example, pandemicpreparedness and estimating the global population. the un is mandated toestimate the global population and prepare population projections.covid-19 is a significant disruption to normal population growth trendsand must be factored into any future estimates. global excess mortalityassociated with the covid-19 pandemic provides a key input to this work, showing theeffects of the pandemic on the global population now, but also thelonger tail effects on future population projections. the importance ofthis should not be underestimated as population is one of the mostimportant

prioritization of the worst-off. for this reason,it is imperative that the different values be weighed and applied to specific allocation issuesusing a fair process.a fair process for allocating scarce resources must promote certain ethical values:transparency. in a transparent process, the decisions and their justifications shouldbe made public. this means that the population should be informed about the criteriaguiding the decisions.inclusiveness. those affected by allocation decisions – including individuals,communities or countries – should be able to exert at least some influence over thedecision-making process as well as the decision itself. this also means that decisions4should be open to challenge and potentially revisable, perhaps through an appealprocess. consistency. decisions should be consistent so that all persons in the same categoriesare treated in the same way. this means that favouritism towards one’s own family,religious or political compatriots, or otherwise, is not appropriate. all forms ofcorruption that are at variance with this principle should be challenged andcondemned. accountability. those making decisions about allocation must be accountable forthose decisions – that is, they should justify their decisions and be held responsible forthem. a fair process means that allocation decisions should not be made byindividuals, by individual pharmaceutical companies, or, in the case of allocationbetween countries, by a single country. resources such as vaccines and therapiesshould not be stockpiled outside the system of fair allocation.the fair allocation of resources is one that is valuable in itself precisely because it is fair.however, it may also be valuable because a fair system engenders solidarity
